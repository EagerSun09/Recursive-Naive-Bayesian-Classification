I test this program(main.py) in pycharm.
To run the program(main.py), make sure it's in the same folder with data.txt.

When running the program, first you will be asked to tune 'hyper-parameters'. the answer to add extra feature must be 'y' or 'n'('y' for adding and 'n' for not).

First, we load data and transform data to managable type(string to float).
Second, we let NaN value equal to 0. This could prevent the interruption of NaN value, since the probability of 0 to be airplane or bird will be both 0.
Third, we use the recursive bayesian estimation to get the probability of one object to be airplane or bird based on their velocity.
Finally, we classified objects based on their probabilities.

I do add extra feature.
The extra feature I add is: the absolute value of difference between the one data and its previous data.
I learned that birds tend to have an un-smooth trajectory and will sudden change in velocity but planes cannot make such changes; thus, if the absolute value of difference between two consecutive velocities is big enough, this means this object would probably be a bird.

By adding extra feature, I improve the accuracy from 80% to 90%.
